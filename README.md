# Welcome to routify.js

routify.js (yes, is the most unintrusive, and yet most powerful, client-side routing system for Single Page Applications (SPas) out there.
It's written in modern ES6 Javascript, has fallback support, and it does as little as possible while being very powerful.

It supports sub-routes, each one with different fallbacks.

## It works everywhere

routify.js is written in pure Javascript, and it will work:

*  Straight HTML files. Here is a guide to [turn a simple HTML file in to a routing-aware page](https://mobily-enterprises.github.io/routify/guides/01-straight-html.html),

* lit-element. routify.js provides two mixins which will enable routing for your main page
and any other pages in no time. ([routify.js has a simple lit-html guide](https://mobily-enterprises.github.io/routify/guides/02-open-wc-to-routify.html))

* _(more to come)_
